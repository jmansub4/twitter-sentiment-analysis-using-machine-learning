    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will perform basic sentiment analysis on collected COVID19-related Twitter data, using the TextBlob and VADER sentiment analysis tools. These tools use a lexicon (i.e. a dictionary/vocabulary of words and their respective sentiment scores - see the example lexicon in the table below) and rule-based approach to classify text as either negative, neutral or positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "![lexicon.png](attachment:lexicon.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexicon-based methods make use of a collection of words, each of which are assigned a polarity score, to decide the general sentiment score of a given text. This method is more accessible as it does not require the training of a model to be able to classify sentiment. However, the fact that sentiment is calculated based on the polarity score of each word in the text can lead to errors in sentiment classification. Such errors may arise due to a lack of understanding of various language traits such as sarcasm or even variations in the use of word the same word. Take, for example, the following phrases: \"He killed many people\" and \"I killed it in that exam\". In the second phrase the word killied is not used in a negative context. "

Polarity is denoted by a score between -1 and 1, with scores < 0, scores = 0 and scores > 0 corresponding to negative, neutral and positive sentiment, respectively. Subjectivity is denoted by a score between 0 and 1 and is a score of whether the statement is deemed as more fact, or opinion based.\n",

    "Before making use of the sentiment property of TextBlob, it's good practice to know what's going on behind the scenes. As mentioned previously, TextBlob is a lexicon based method. For a large library of words, researchers have assigned a respective polarity and subjectivity score. For a given text, TextBlob then finds all words and phrases from a given text that it can assign both a polarity and subjectivity to, and averages them to produce the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "TextBlob's sentiment analysis is also rule-based, it applies various actions to existing polarity and subjectivity scores according to a set of pre-defined rules. For example, the word 'good' has a polarity score of 0.7, but if the word 'not' appears in front of it, then in order to determine the polarity of the phrase 'not good', the polarity of 'good' is multipled by -0.5, yielding a score of -0.35. Punctuation, especially exclamation points, also increase the positive or negative intensity of the polarity score."

    "Let's now try performing a sentiment analysis using the [VADER](https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/) (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool, which, like TextBlob, uses a lexicon and rule-based method to assign sentiment scores. The VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer tool is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. Performing sentiment analysis on social media posts is challenging as you are often dealing with short snippets of text, as well as slang and abbreviated language. These challenges were given special consideration during the development of VADER's sentiment analyser. As mentioned previously, lexicons consist of a large library of words which are classed as negative, neutral or positive. In addition, the VADER lexicon also includes acronyms (lol, btw etc.) and slang (meh, nah etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the TextBlob method, VADER also applies grammatical rules which affect the sentiment of the text. However, the rules applied by the VADER sentiment analyser are more sophisticated. VADER is sensitive to both the polarity (whether the sentiment is positive or negative), as well as the intensity (how positive or negative is sentiment) of emotions in the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capiltalisation increases the positive or negative intensity of the sentiment score, i.e. the text \"I am very happy today\" will have a different sentiment score to \"I am VERY happy today\".\n",
    "- The word \"but\" signifies a shift in sentiment of the text, with the sentiment score then dominated by the second part of the sentence.\n",
    "- Certain \"booster words\" also either increase or decrease the intensity of the sentiment. For example, the word \"extremely\", i.e. \"The food is extremely good” is more intense than \"The food is good\".\n",
    "- The VADER model also catches nearly 90% of cases where negation flips the sentiment of the text. For example, a negated sentence would be \"The food isn’t really all that great\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given text, VADER outputs a scores for the negative, neutral and positive sentiment categories, as well as a compound score, which is a “normalized, weighted, composite\" score and is a good overall indication of the assigned sentiment."
